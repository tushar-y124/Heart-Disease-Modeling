\# Heart Disease Modeling Project



As part of the \*\*Data Science Fundamentals with Python\*\* course, I applied machine learning techniques to the UCI Heart Disease dataset to predict heart disease and analyze clinical risk factors.



\## Key Tasks

\- \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\* and preprocessing (imputation, feature scaling).

\- Built and evaluated classification models:

&nbsp; - Logistic Regression

&nbsp; - Random Forest

&nbsp; - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

\- Developed a \*\*multiple linear regression\*\* model to predict cholesterol levels.

\- Applied \*\*Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\*\* for dimensionality reduction and visualized explained variance.

\- Implemented \*\*K-means clustering\*\* on PCA-reduced data:

&nbsp; - Used Elbow Method \& Silhouette Score for optimal cluster selection.



\## Dataset

\- \*\*Source\*\*: \[UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)

\- Contains clinical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more.



\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Scikit-learn

\- Matplotlib, Seaborn

\- Jupyter Notebook



\## Installation

```bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/heart-disease-modeling.git

cd heart-disease-modeling

pip install -r requirements.txt
